1. Simple Cache:
    - Creates a singleton thread-safe cache.
    - Checks for "assignable" type safety at runtime during "put" operation.
    - If a cache instance is created for key of type A and value of type B, the cache can only be used for type A and B per JVM instance.

2. People Directed Graph
    - Could be implemented better by taking care of Node immutability and Node equality
    - Mostly traverses the graph using various visitors (stateful and stateless) to implement the necessary methods
